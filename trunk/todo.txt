For now, the following list is not ordered properly to reflect the priority.

REAL SHORT TERM TASK LIST
-------------------------
** Complete SpriteMan		(in progress)
** Complete SequenceMan
** Complete TextureMan		(in progress)
** Complete ImageMan		(in progress)
** Complete SoundMan
** Complete DebugDrawMan	(in progress)
** Add them all to Engine for now

If have time before JAM
** Complete FactoryMan and Entity Factory

TRACK
- Trackable: Position x/y, Scale x/y, Alpha, 

KEY
- Value, In v, Out v, Type

ENGINE
- Have some sort of field class
** Define data, vector field ? Model density, mineral concentration ?
** Have some basic visual representation for different type of soil including mineral. Marching square ?
- Maybe have a proxy engine that any objects can use. Now, all objects know engine and engine knows all objects.

- Have some sort of cheezy physics/collision detection engine
** Make sure pods and ground collides
** Make sure we can shoot pods (ballistics)
** Internal refactoring: body signal need to be transfer to physics manager so we do not have "big loops" several times per update.

- Better handle multiple inputs for multiplayer
** If playing on same computer

- Get network support
** Make sure current engine architecture works with network

- Work on minimal GUI module (or get an open source one)
** Needed for pod controls such as deploy, salvage, etc.
** Text display
** Sprite display

- Need to implement an image loader (or get an open source one)

GAMEPLAY
- Have the pods harvest delirium ore
* Display pump shaft

- Have projectiles destroy soil layers, mineral deposit.
** Create math model for explosions and how the affect soil (take into account soil density)
** Simulate cave in when holes are created ?

- Try out different kind of soil density to affect digging and harvesting

- Try out infector pod to affect ore harvest rate

- Try out defender pod

- Try out soft bombs that harden top soils to slow down digging

- Try out probe pod to scan soil layers and display delirium ore deposit

- Try out turn based gameplay. Maybe it could be more fun.
